Hi everyone !

A brief about me: I am Software Developer, now I am working in a Travel company dealing most of the time with Ruby On Rails problems. However, I am a tech passionate, and I am always learning new technologies, so I know how you feel about dealing with new code or even learning a new tech.

Furthermore, I want to thank everyone who is doing this challenge for encouraging me to do it. The main rule is to build little projects in a span of 100 days. So if you are interested in participate, here are the rules (Or at least, the rules I follow):

#### The rules of the game

1.  **The objective:** Build a whole new project. The main objective is to do it in one day.
2.  **Learn new technology:** Take care of your time, maybe you have to invest some minutes reading some tutorials.
3.  **Share:** Share what you learned doing the project. In a blog, medium, or your website.
4.  **Make your learning public:** Publish in some public repository.

#### My settings

-   I will post everything in this medium blog: Stay tuned for new posts !
-   All the code will be available here: [https://github.com/sanatem/100DaysOfCode](https://github.com/sanatem/100DaysOfCode)

That's all folks ! Happy coding ! See you in my next post.
